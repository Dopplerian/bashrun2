+configure-modes () {

    +mode launcher
      # This is the default "launcher" mode that provides a terminal
      # in the fashion of a run dialog.

      --terminal "xterm -geometry %g -name bashrun-%m"
      # Specify the terminal to use for bashrun. Within this string,
      # %g expands to the first geometry given in --geometry below.
      # %m expands to the name of this mode. Bashrun expects the name
      # portion of the WM_CLASS property of the terminal window to be
      # set to "bashrun-<modename>". For xterm and the *rxvt's, the
      # "-name" option can be used for this, as seen above. This
      # replaces the former XTERM, XTERM_OPTIONS, FGCOLOR and BGCOLOR
      # settings.

      --geometry '40x1 40x8'
      # Set the geometry or geometries to use for the terminal
      # window. If more than one geometry is used, the cycle-size
      # action (C-l) will allow you to cycle through these geometries.
      # This replaces the former (SMALL|LARGE)_(COLUMNS|LINES)
      # settings.

      --completion 'menu-complete complete 8'
      # Set the readline completion function to use with tab. The
      # first word of this string specifies the completion to use by
      # default. The second word, if given, specifies an alternative
      # completion type to use when the size of the terminal exceeds
      # the number of lines given in the third word.  This replaces
      # the former COMPLETION_TYPE, ALTERNATIVE_COMPLETION_TYPE and
      # COMPLETION_THRESHOLD settings.

      --unmap true
      # Whether to unmap the window after running a command. Setting
      # this value to "false" is equivalent to using KEEP_OPEN=yes in
      # previous versions.

      --feedback true
      # Whether to show feedback in the form of a progress bar during
      # startup.

      # --onmap 'transset-df -a 0.75' 
      ## A command to run after the window has been mapped and focused. This
      ## setting replaces the former POST_MAP_COMMAND.

      --logfile '/dev/tty9'
      # Set the logfile to redirect command output to. This replaces
      # the former LOGFILE setting.

    # Configure terminals to launch commands in. In the string given

    # is replaced by the string given with --geometry. %f ist replaced
    # by the string given with --font. 
    #
    # Note that if you use %g or %f in the command string, the values
    # of --geometry and --font will be inserted into the string even
    # if they are empty, so make sure those values are defined.

    # The following two terminals are defined by default:

    +terminal default --command "xterm -e bash -c %c"
    # The default terminal to launch commands in if no other terminal
    # has been requested by an action or an action rule, see below.

    +terminal notify 
      --command "xterm -g %g -e bash -c %c"
      --geometry "40x4+0+0"

    # ^ A small terminal for notifications, used by the default actions
    # "term-notify" and "su-term-notify".

    # Here's an example of a urxvt terminal using a small font. See
    # the +configure-rules function below for an example of how to use
    # it.

}

+configure-rules () {

    # Rules can be used to associate actions with specific commands or
    # commandlines. For actions that run commands in a terminal, a
    # terminal defined in the section above can also be
    # associated. The --add option adds one or more command
    # specifications to a rule, separated by whitespace.
    #
    # A command specification can be either the command name itself or
    # a regular expression that is applied to the complete
    # commandline. Both may optionally be followed by a colon,
    # followed by the name of the terminal to use.
    #
    # Regular expressions are denoted by enclosing them in '/'. Note
    # that you don't have to quote literal slashes inside the regular
    # expression, since the enclosing slashes are used solely to tell
    # bashrun that it should interpret the contents as a regular
    # expression.
    #
    # This is the equivalent of the RULES array used in previous
    # versions.
    #
    # Some examples:

    +rule term-run
      --add "watch top:small"
      # the term-run action is used to run 'watch' in the default
      # terminal and 'top' in the 'small' terminal defined above

    +rule term-page
      --add 'dict' 
      # the the term-page action is uesed to show the output of
      # 'dict', paged in the default terminal.
     
      --add '/^ls/:small'
      # the term-page action is used to show the output of any
      # commandline beginning with 'ls' paged in the 'small' terminal.

    +rule su-term-notify
      --add '/^/etc/rc.d/'
      # use the su-term-notify action to run any commandline beginning
      # with '/etc/rc.d' as root and show it's output in the 'notify'
      # terminal, closing the terminal after two seconds. Note that in
      # this case, the su-term-notify function already chooses to use
      # the 'notify' terminal.

    # Finally, if there is a terminal defined by the exact name of the
    # command, then that terminal is chosen automatically, e.g. if you
    # have a terminal called "alsamixer", then simply adding
    # "alsamixer" to the "term-run" rule is equivalent to adding
    # "alsamixer:alsamixer"
}

+configure-handlers () {

    # Handlers provide a way to handle non-executable commandlines in
    # a special way and thus extend bashrun's functionality. If the
    # commandline entered into bashrun is not executable (i.e. it's
    # not an exported function, an alias or an executable) then an
    # attempt is made to successively match the commandline against
    # each of the handlers defined here.
    #
    # If the regular expression given in --pattern matches the
    # commandline, then the file test pattern given in --test can
    # optionally be applied first. If no test was given or if the
    # supplied test succeeds, then either the value of --string will
    # be used as the command to execute, with the commandline itself
    # passed as the argument, or, if the regexp contains
    # subexpressions within parenthesis, an attempt will be made to
    # substitute the occurence of %[1-9] in the value of --string with
    # the contents of the corresponding subexpression match. In this
    # case, the modified handler string is used as the commandline
    # without adding further arguments.
    #
    # The --action option may be used to delegate the resulting string
    # to a specific action for further processing instead of simply
    # trying to execute it.
    #
    # In addition, handlers provide a simple interface to programmable
    # completion. The command word to complete can be supplied via the
    # --complete option, and a function called
    # +handler-<handlername>-complete can be defined to generate a
    # list of strings to complete against.

    +handler info
      --pattern '(.+)\?\?'
      --string '%1'
      --action show-info
      # E.g. if you type "bash??" then the string "bash" is used as
      # the commandline to be run with the show-info action, which
      # pages 'info bash' in the default terminal, unless a rule
      # indictates to run info with a different action or in a
      # specific terminal.
      
    +handler manual
      --pattern '(.+)\?'
      --string '%1'
      --action show-manual
      # Similar to the above, but shows manual pages instead. Note
      # that the order of handlers is important here: if this handler
      # were defined before the info handler, then the info handler
      # would never be reached.      

    +handler browse
      --pattern 'browse (.*)'
      --string '%1'
      --action browse
      --complete 'browse'

      +handler-browse-complete () { +bookmarks --list; }
      # the --complete option for this handler installs a function
      # named "browse", for which the +handler-complete-browse
      # function is used to generate the list of possible matches from
      # bashrun's bookmarks. Thus you can just type "browse " and hit
      # tab to get at your bookmarks.

    +handler http
      --pattern '^(www|https?)'   
      --action browse
      # A simple url handler, for lines beginning with http, https or
      # www.

    +handler tlds

      --action browse
      # Another url handler that matches the end of the commandline,

    +handler google
      --pattern '^gg:(.+)'
      --string  'www.google.com/search?q=%1'
      --action browse
      # An example of a Konqueror-style shortcut: if you type
      # "gg:foo", then the %1 in "www.google.com/search?q=%1" will be
      # replaced by foo, and the resulting url will be passed to the
      # browse action, which finally launches "$BROWSER <url>"

      --test 'f!x'
      --string 'gimp'
      # This handler implements a file association by matching any
      # commandline ending in .jpg or .jpeg. It then tests whether the
      # commandline is a path to a file that is not executable by
      # applying the file test pattern "f!x".  If the test succeeds,
      # the file is opened in gimp.
      #
      # For a more universal solution to file associations, see the
      # "file" fallback handler below.

    +handler video
      --pattern '\.(avi|mpe?g|flv|mp4|wmv|mov)$'

      --string '%1 --help'
      --action term-page
      # E.g. ?bash pages "bash --help" in a terminal

    # The following handlers are fallback handlers, which means they
    # are guaranteed to be at the end of the handler list, and will
    # match any non-executable commandline not yet handled by a
    # previous handler. The first two of these use a file test
    # operator prepended to the handler string to check whether the
    # commandline is a path to a directory or a file,
    # respectively. See bashrun(1) for details.
    #
    # The directory handler is equivalent of the former DIRHANDLER
    # setting. The 'google-fallback' handler, if present, is
    # equivalent to using GOOGLE_FALLBACK=yes in previous versions.
